One of them – “The Kitchen Songs” – came out with the flag of the defending country.

As part of the concert, the wife of the Ambassador of Ukraine to Kazakhstan, Oksana Vrublevskaya, expressed her gratitude to the Kazakhstan people: "It is impossible to fight absolute evil alone. It will engulf and crush. But you need to fight it. It should not be allowed to develop, because any piece of the globe could be in the place of my homeland. And we can only win together." "As a rule, I am asked only two questions. The first is how you can help and how you can bring help. And the second – where is the truth? The truth, my friends, is in our hearts, because the heart always really feels and knows where this truth is," Vrublevskaya finished, asking everyone to hold a minute of silence in memory of all those who died in the war. "Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!", the audience supported her.

During the second day of the event, guests could take master classes in djing, contemp, training on breathing practices and deflections, as well as attend lectures on finding inner support.
