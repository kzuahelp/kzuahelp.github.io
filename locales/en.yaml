    <p>Our movement for collecting humanitarian aid began on February 25 along with the <i>El bolashagy</i> civil initiative statement.</p>
    <p><i>El bolashagy</i> started the movement, organized volunteers, and called on Kazakhstanis to help the civilian population of Ukraine that needs emergency humanitarian assistance in times of war.</p>
    <p>After <i>El bolashagy</i> withdrew from the movement on March 13, the initiative was taken over by volunteers — ordinary Kazakhstanis from the Humanitarian Aid Headquarters. Now they are organizing and sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine on their own.</p>
    <p>As of March 5, more than 150 million tenge (around $300.000) were raised by caring Kazakhstanis.</p>
